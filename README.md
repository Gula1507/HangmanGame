Hangman game is a computer-based version of the classic two-player word game of the same name.

The human player competes against the computer to guess a word the program has selected at random.

Each time the player inputs a letter, the computer will either display the letter where it appears in the word or draw more of the hangman. Gameplay continues until the player guesses the word or runs out of guesses and the stick figure is hung.
